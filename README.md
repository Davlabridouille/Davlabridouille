## Whoami
- 👋 Hi, I’m __David Roméo AMEDOMEY__ *@damedomey*
- 👀 I’m interested in __system and network administration__ and __cyber security__.
- 🌱 I'm currently studying at the University Institute __les Cours Sonou__ in the field of SIL (Computer System and Software).
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects that will allow me to learn new things. Obviously cyber security or administration oriented.
- 📫 How to reach me ...

## What can I do?
- I master the basics of system administration (Linux in particular)
- Web development (front and backend) using HTML, CSS(bootstrap), JS (nodejs, jquery), PHP, MySQL
- Development of desktop applications
Frankly, I rarely make desktop applications (actually)... I usually develop desktop applications using C, C++(Qt for the graphical ones), the Electronjs framework,
a little bit of python3 too.

## Weakness...
- Design🙈...
I design interfaces without worries, but if I have to design them from scratch, then good luck to you🤭😅. Nevertheless, I can improve existing mockups or interfaces.💪
